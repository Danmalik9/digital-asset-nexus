# Digital Asset Nexus

A robust Clarity smart contract platform enabling peer-to-peer trading of digital assets on the Stacks blockchain with comprehensive ownership tracking and community feedback mechanisms.

## What is Digital Asset Nexus?

Digital Asset Nexus is a next-generation smart contract system built on Stacks that facilitates secure, transparent transactions for digital assets. The platform streamlines asset registration, discovery, acquisition, and feedback collection while maintaining immutable records of ownership transitions and marketplace activity.

The system serves multiple use cases:
- Trade digital resources with cryptographic ownership verification
- Execute secondary market transactions with automatic compensation
- Maintain detailed provenance records for all asset transfers
- Build creator reputation through buyer feedback and ratings
- Track market dynamics with real-time activity metrics

Core capabilities:
- Asset registration with flexible metadata structures
- Secure peer-to-peer transactions with commission handling
- Complete ownership history preservation
- Community evaluation system with tamper-proof records
- Secondary market support for resale operations
- Activity tracking across market segments

## System Design

The solution leverages a unified smart contract architecture to coordinate all platform activities:

```

      ↓              ↓              ↓
   [Vendor]      [Buyer]      [Platform]
```

### Component Overview:
1. **Registry Operations**: Asset enrollment, property management, and lifecycle control
2. **Transaction Processing**: Purchase execution, fee distribution, ownership transfer
3. **Ledger Management**: Chronological tracking of all ownership changes
4. **Reputation System**: Feedback capture, rating validation, and reputation metrics
5. **Market Intelligence**: Segment activity tracking and trend analysis

## API Reference

### Public Transactions

#### Asset Management
```clarity
(register-asset (name ascii(100)) 
                (metadata utf8(500)) 
                (cost uint) 
                (sector ascii(50))
                (thumbnail-uri utf8(200))
                (resource-uri utf8(200))
                (royalty-share uint))

(modify-asset (asset-id uint) ...)
(deactivate-asset (asset-id uint))
```

#### Purchase & Resale
```clarity
(acquire-asset (asset-id uint))
(relist-asset (asset-id uint) (new-cost uint))
```

#### Feedback
```clarity
(post-feedback (asset-id uint) (rating uint) (text utf8(300)))
```

### Query Functions
```clarity
(fetch-asset (asset-id uint))
(verify-acquisition (asset-id uint) (subject principal))
(query-feedback (asset-id uint) (subject principal))
(read-market-metrics (sector ascii(50)) (period-key ascii(7)))
(fetch-owner-record (asset-id uint) (seq uint))
(count-registered-assets)
```

## Usage Guide

### Deployment
1. Install Clarinet:
```bash
npm install -g clarinet
```
2. Initialize workspace:
```bash
clarinet new my-nexus-project
```
3. Execute test suite:
```bash
clarinet test
```

### Development Workflow
1. Open Clarinet REPL:
```bash
clarinet console
```
2. Invoke contract operations programmatically
3. Query state and verify results

## Technical Implementation

### Platform Configuration
- **Commission Rate**: 5% on all transactions
- **Maximum Royalty**: 15% creator royalty threshold
- **Rating Scale**: 0-5 point feedback system
- **Asset Limit**: Unlimited registration capacity

### Constraints & Safeguards
- Asset URLs remain stored on-chain (verify external integrity)
- Block height approximates temporal metrics
- Feedback scores bounded to maximum permitted value
- Single feedback entry per buyer per asset
- Vendor authorization required for asset modifications

### Operational Best Practices
- Verify buyer credentials before accepting payment
- Confirm asset active status prior to transaction
- Maintain adequate STX reserves for commission payments
- Review feedback summaries before purchasing
- Ensure cost values denominated in microSTX (µSTX) units
